# Formula Racing Manager

This Unity game was made as an assignment for a Digital Games discipline I'm making in college. It's a
simple game where the cars follow a path and the velocity changes depending where the car is on the track
and how fast the player is telling the driver to go.

The idea is to simulate the position of a team manager in a motorsport championship, where the player must
decide how much of the resources the drivers should use in each lap, which tyres should be used in the race
and when the pit stops will happen.
